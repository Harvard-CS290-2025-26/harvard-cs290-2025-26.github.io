**Pre-class Work:** (instructions on canvas)
* In this class we will discuss and practice how to update your advisor(s)/collaborator(s) on recent progress. Please come to class with a topic in mind â€“ a project (e.g. current or past research project, a hobbie, etc.) that you have worked on but haven't yet completed. The topic should be reasonably technical (your fellow classmates should only have a partial prior understanding of the topic).
* Reflect on your own strategies for updating collaborators on progress.
